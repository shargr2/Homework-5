# Background
For this project I created charts to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

I used a rideshare app's complete recordset of rides. It contains information about every active driver and historic ride including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

# Step by Step
The Bubble Plot showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, there are three pie charts showing the following:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type
